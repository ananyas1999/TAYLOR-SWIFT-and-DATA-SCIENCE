# TAYLOR-SWIFT-and-DATA-SCIENCE
✨ Welcome to the Eras of Exploratory Analysis! From Fearless feature engineering to Reputation-level sentiment analysis, this is where Swiftie passion meets Python precision 💻🐍



1. **SENTIMENT ANALYSIS**


Imagine reading Taylor’s lyrics and asking:
🧠 “Is this song happy or sad?”
🗣️ “Is Taylor telling a personal story or stating a fact?”

Sentiment and subjectivity analysis helps us quantify those emotions and tones using Natural Language Processing (NLP). Here's what the two terms mean:

Sentiment Polarity -> Measures if the lyric feels positive, neutral, or negative | Ranges from -1 (very sad/angry) to +1 (very happy/loving)

Subjectivity -> Measures how personal or emotional the lyric is vs. just stating facts | Ranges from 0 (factual) to 1 (opinionated or emotional)

By doing sentiment and subjectivity analysis on Taylor Swift's lyrics, we're answering questions like:
Which albums are more emotionally uplifting or darker in tone?
Which albums contain the most deeply personal storytelling?
How has Taylor’s emotional tone shifted across her career and re-recordings?
Can fans or listeners get a quick idea of the "mood" of an album before listening?

Sentiment Polarity Chart
Albums like Hannah Montana: The Movie, The More Lover Chapter, and Folklore (Deluxe) have the most positive average sentiment.
Albums like Women in Music Pt. III, 1989 (Deluxe), and Fifty Shades Darker are on the more negative side. 
This tells us which albums feel emotionally lighter vs. darker overall.

ONE DRAWBACK I FACED HERE - SINCE THE REPOSITORY CONSISTS OF ALL SONGS BY TAYLOR, THERE ARE ALBUMS THAT ARE MOVIES AND NOT STANDALONE TAYLOR ALBUMS. 

Subjectivity Chart
Albums like Women in Music Pt. III and 1989 (Deluxe) are super subjective, meaning the lyrics are highly personal/opinion-based.
Hannah Montana: The Movie and The More Lover Chapter are on the less subjective side (more descriptive or storytelling-like).
