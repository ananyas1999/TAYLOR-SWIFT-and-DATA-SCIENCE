‚ú® Welcome to the Eras of Exploratory Analysis! From Fearless feature engineering to Reputation-level sentiment analysis, this is where Swiftie passion meets Python precision üíªüêç


**SENTIMENT ANALYSIS**

Sentiment Polarity Chart
Albums like Hannah Montana: The Movie, The More Lover Chapter, and Folklore (Deluxe) have the most positive average sentiment.
Albums like Women in Music Pt. III, 1989 (Deluxe), and Fifty Shades Darker are on the more negative side. 
This tells us which albums feel emotionally lighter vs. darker overall.

ONE DRAWBACK I FACED HERE - SINCE THE REPOSITORY CONSISTS OF ALL SONGS BY TAYLOR, THERE ARE ALBUMS THAT ARE MOVIES AND NOT STANDALONE TAYLOR ALBUMS.
